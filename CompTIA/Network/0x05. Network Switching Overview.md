# Network Switching Overview

## The Switch
- Forward or drop frames
	- Based on the destination MAC address
- Gather a constantly updating list of MAC address
	- builds the list based on the source MAC address of incoming traffic
- Maintain a loop-free environment
	- Using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

## Frame Switching
- Switch has its own table storing `MAC address` and associated `Output Interface`
- Switch sends frame to not only the device, also the other **Swtich** too!
- `Switch` has **NO** idea what the next step is going to be.

## Learning the MACs
- When the Switch just turned on, its' MAC address table is empty.
- Switch starts to learn the MAC address and the output interface by examining the incoming traffic.

## Flooding for unknown MACs
- Switch has an empty MAC address table initially
- So, If Switch doesn't have the proper `MAC address` on its own table yet, It just sends the frame to all of the devices that is connected to it.
- If the devices' MAC address doesn't match with the frame 

## Address Resolution Protocol
- Determine a MAC address based on an IP address
	- By sending a `ARP request`, asking their MAC address based on their IP address
