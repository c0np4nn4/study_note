# Introduction to IP

## A series of moving vans
- Moving data thorugh the `Network` is like moving tons of `boxes` with the `truck`.
- `The network topology` is the `road`.
- `The boxes` is the `packet` of the  data, which could be either `TCP` or `UDP`.
- Inside the boxes are the actual `data`  for applications.

## IP - Internet Protocol
> 1. Ethernet
- Ethernet network packet looks like below.
```
| Ethernet Header |    Ethernet Payload    | Ethernet Trailer |

```

> 2. IP Traffic
```
| Ethernet Header | IP |     IP Payload    | Ethernet Trailer |

```

> 3. TCP
```
| Ethernet Header | IP | TCP | TCP Payload | Ethernet Trailer |

```

- which could be
```
| Ethernet Header | IP | TCP |  HTTP DATA  | Ethernet Trailer |

```

- So, in order to send the `HTTP DATA`, it must be encapsulated within `TCP`, `IP`, and `Ethernet` sequentially.


## TCP, UDP
- Transported inside of IP
	- Encapsulated by IP Protocol
- Two ways t move data from place to place
	- Different features for different applications
- `OSI Layer 4`
	- The Transport Layer
- Multiplexing
	- Use many different applications at the same time
	- `TCP` and `UDP`

### TCP
- Connection-Oriented
	- A Formal connection setup and close
- `Reliable` delivery
	- Recovery from errors
	- Can manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions
- Flow Control
	- The receiver can manage how much data is sent

### UDP
- Connection-less
	- No formal open or close to the connection
	- just hopes to receive the data...
- `Unreliable` delivery
	- No error recovery
	- No reordering of data or retransmissions
- No Flow control
	- Sender determines the amount of data transmitted

## Speedy delivery
- The IP Delivery truck delivers from one (IP) address to another (IP) address
	- Every house has an address, every computer has an IP address
- Boxes arrive at the house / IP address
	- Where do the boxes go?
	- Each box has a room name
- Port is written on the outside of the box
	- Drop the box into the right room (port)

## Lots of Ports
- IPv4 sockets
	- Server IP address, protocol(TCP, UDP), server application port number
	- Client IP address, protocol(TCP, UDP), client port number
- Non-ephemeral ports (permanent port numbers)
	- Ports 0 through 1,023
	- Usually on a server or service
- Ephemeral ports (temporary port numbers)
	- Ports 1,024 thorugh 65,535
	- Determined in real-time by the client

## Port numbers
- TCP and UDP ports can be any number between 0 and 65,535
- Most servers (services) use non-ephemeral (non-temporary) port numbers
- **Port number is just for communication, not security**
- Service port numbers need to be `Well Known`
- TCP Port numbers are not the same as UDP port numbers

## Ports on the network
- Web server - `TCP/80`
- VoIP server - `UDP/5004`
- Email server - `TCP/143`

## ICMP
- Internet Control Message Protocol
	- `Text messaging` for your network devices
- Another protocol carried by IP
	- Not used for data transfer
- Devices can request and reply to administrative requests
	- `Are you there?`
- Devices can send messages when things don't go well
	- That network you're tyring to reach is not reachable from here
	- Your time-to-live expired, just letting you know
