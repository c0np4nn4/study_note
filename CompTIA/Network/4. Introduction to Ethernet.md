# Introduction to Ethernet

## SOHO LAN
- Techinically, SOHO(Small Office Home Office) LAN is looks like..

| Internet | Router | Switch | Local Computer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

- Send Information from `Computer` to `Internet`
- Get Information from `Internet` to `Computer`

## Enterprise Network
- Enterprise network is basically similiar with SOHO environment
- The only difference is that the size of the network is larger, so there might be some added managing points.
- There is `core switch` inside of the network, which can send the packet to the each individual `switch` and then to the `computer`

## The Ethernet Frame

| Preamble | SFD | Destination MAC | Source MAC | Type | Payload | FCS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- `Preamble`: 56 altering ones and zeros used for synchronization (101010...)
- `SFD`: Start Frame Delimiter, designates the end of the preamble
- `Destination MAC`: The destination address of this frame
- `Source MAC`: The source address of this frame
- `Type`: Describes the data contained the payload
- `Payload`: Layer 3 and higher data (TCP data, browser data, etc)
- `FCS`: Frame Check Sequence, CRC checksum of the frame

## The MAC Address
- Ethernet `Media Access Control` Address
	- The "Physical" address of a network adapter
	- Unique to a device
- 48 bits / 6 bytes long
	- Displayed in hexadecimal
		- `8c: 2d: aa`: `4b: 98: a7`
		- `The first section`: Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI, The manufacturer)
		- `The second section`: Network Interface Controller-Specific (The serial number)

## Duplex
- When the Ethernet devices are connected to the network, one of the configuration parameter named *Duplex* will be set.
- There are usually two types of duplex, `half-duplex` and `full-duplex`
- `Half-Duplex`
	- A device cannot send and receive simultaneously
	- All LAN hubs are half-duplex devices
	- Switch interfaces can be configured as half-duplex
		- But usually only when connecting to other half-duplex device 
		- and these days, `switch` usually be configured as **full duplex**.
- `Full-Duplex`
	- Data can be sent and received at the same time
	- A properly configured switch interface will be set to full-duplex

### Half-Duplex Hub (Old hub)
- Traffic received on one interface is repeated to all other interfaces
- If two devices are trying to communicate simultaneously, you've got a **Collision**
	- everybody on the network will hear that collision
	- waiting for random time and just hoping collision will not be occured again...

### CSMA/CD (Half-Duplex communication model?)
- CS: Carrier Sense
	- Check for carrier that carring data
- MA: Multiple Access
	- More than one device on the network
- CD: Collision Detect
	- Identify when data gets garbled
- Modern switch networks configured the devices as `Full-Duplex`, so this might not be used anymore

### CSMA/CD Operation
- **Listening** for an opening
	- Don't transmit if the network is already busy
- **Sending** a frame of data
	- There's no queue or prioritization
	- Can send a data whenever you want
- if a **Collision** occurs
	- Transmit a jam signal to let everyone know a collision has occurred
	- Wait a random amount of time
	- Retry the transmission

## Full-Duplex Ethernet
- i.e. Wireless Network
- The `Frame` has `Source MAC Address` and `Destination MAC address`
- Frame is sent to `Switch`
- `Switch` might have to find another `swtich` which is connected to the destination device
-**Full-Duplex**
	- Send and Receive can be occurred simultaneously
	
### CSMA/CA
- CA: Collision Avoidance
	- Common on wireless networks
- Collision detection isn't possible
	- A sending station can't "hear" other stations
- Use `RTS` / `CTS`
	- `RTS`: **R**eady **T**o **S**end
	- `CTS`: **C**lear **T**o **S**end
	- So, the devices should get the permission from the access point when they want to send a data.
- This method solves the `Hidden Node` Problem
	- multiple devices connected to the access point might doesn't know each other, but the network still works
