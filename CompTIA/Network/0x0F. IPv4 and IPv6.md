# IPv4 and IPv6

## The IP address of a device
- A *unique* number of device
	- Every device needs a unique IP address
- `subnet mask`
	- Usually combined with IP address
	- Used by the local workstation to determine what subnet it's on
		- The subnet mask isn't transmitted across the network

## The secret behind the IP address
- The `IP address` isn't really a single address.
- An `IP address` is a combination of a network ID and a host ID
	- The subnet mask determines what part of the `IP address` is the network and which part is the host
		- The `subnet mask` is just as important as your `IP address`
- The best way to see this work is in binary
	- This is the (very easy) math

## IPv4 address
- **Internet Protocol version 4**
- `OSI Layer 3 address`

| 192 | 168 | 1 | 131 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 11000000 | 10101000 | 00000001 | 10000011 |

- composed with 4 *octets* (8-bit)

## IPv6 address
- **Internet Protocol v6**
- **128-bit** address == **16-byte**
- `DNS` will become very important!

## IPv6 address compression
- Groups of zeros can be abbreviated with a double colon.
- Leading zeros are optional


| 2600 | DDDD | 1111 | 0001 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0001 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 2600 | DDDD | 1111 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2600 | DDDD | 1111 | 1 |  |  |  | 1 |

- The result : `2600:DDDD:1111:1::1`
