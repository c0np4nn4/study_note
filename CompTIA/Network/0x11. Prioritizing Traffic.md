# Prioritizing Traffic

## Managing network traffic
- All of devices connected to the computer should be ordered with priority
- Some applications are **more important** than others

## Packet shaping
- traffic shaping
- control with `bandwidth usage` or `data rates`


## QoS (Quality of Service)
- Describes the process of controlling traffic flows
- Many different ways of implementations

## CoS (Class of Service)
- `OSI Layer 2`
- Ethernet frame header in an `802.1Q trunk`
- Usually applied in the intranet (not from an ISP)

## Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
- `OSI Layer 3`
- `QoS bits` are enabled in the IPv4 Header
- Bits are set external to the application
- Routers apply the QoS

- **DSCP** (Differentiated Services Code Point) == Set Bits
