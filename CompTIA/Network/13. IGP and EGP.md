# IGP and EGP

## AS (Autonomous System)
- *Autonomous*
	- Something is existing as an independent entity
- Group of IP routes under common control
- RFC 1930, Section 3: Definitions
	```
	"An AS is a connected group of one or more IP prefixes run
	by one or more network operators which has
	a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED routing policy."
	```

- Important point of reference for discussing IGP and EGP

## IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)
- Used within a single autonomous system (AS)
	- Not intended to route between `AS`
	- That's EGP's role
- IPv4 dynamic routing
	- OSPFv2 (Open Shortest Path First)
	- RIPv2 (Routing Information Protocol)
	- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- IPv6 dynamic routing
	- OSPFv3
	- EIGRP for IPv6
	- RIPng (RIP next generation)

## EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
- Used to route between autonomous systems
	- Leverages the IGP at the `AS` to handle local routing
- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
	- Many organizations use BGP as their EGP

## Interior and Exterior routing
- Let's think about the path between the *Internet* and our *Local Network*
- There's a *Router* in the middle of that path
- There might be another *Router* that connects the *Internet* to the other *Local Network*
- Simply saying, the network related with *Internet* could be said **EGP** and the *Local* one could be said **IGP**
