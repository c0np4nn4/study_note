# Network Segmentation

## LANs (Local Area Networks)
- Local Area Networks
	- A Broadcast Domain
	- A group of devices in the same broadcast domain.
	- All the devices are connected with only one switch, so in aspects of **Security**, the device from outside has no chance to connect to the network
		- (in other words, Each `LAN` doesn't know the other outer `LAN`)
	- **Scalability** is pretty bad, because of the main point of this network design is to maintain the central device(`switch`) but practically it is hard.
## `Virtual LAN`s
- The `Virtual LAN` or `VLAN` can be a solution for the issue above.
	- It still uses a `switch`, but multiple networks can use it as their own `switch`
	- Separating the broadcast domain *logically* instead of *physically*

### Configuring VLANs
- Below is a digram of the `Switch` 

|F0/1|...|...|...|F0/9|...|...|F0/17|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|F0/2|...|...|...|F0/10|...|...|F0/18|

- Let's say 
	- `F0/1` and `F0/2` is `VLAN 1`
	- `F0/9` and `F0/10` is `VLAN 2`
	- `F0/17` and `F0/18` is `VLAN 3`
- `VLAN`s are on the same `switch`, working as a `LAN`
- which means, the devices from each `VLAN` cannot communicate with each other.
- the only way to make it possible is to `route` traffic between the different `VLAN`s

## VLANs on multiple switches
- Let's say there are two physical switches, `Switch 1` and `Switch 2`
- There are also `VLAN`s on each of the switches, named `VLAN 1` and `VLAN 2`
- The `VLAN`s on each of the `Switch` can be connected through a single cable.
- In this way, `LAN`s are more scalable

## VLAN Trunking
- A Single physical connection between the `Switch`es
- Able to transmit multiple `VLAN`s across it
- The standard for `Truking` is called **IEEE 802.1Q.**
	- abbreviation: `dot1Q trunk`
- To make trunking work, the `Ethernet Frame` should be fixed

| Preamble | SFD | Destination MAC | Source MAC | Type | Payload | FCS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


- It is simply just inserting the `VLAN Header` between the `Source MAC address` field and `Type` field.

| Preamble | SFD | Destination MAC | Source MAC | VLAN | Type | Payload | FCS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- `VLAN` field: 12 bits (4,094 VLANs)
- Some devices like `CISCO` switches separates these into two types of range of VLANs 
	- "Normal range": 1 ~ 1,005
	- "Extended range": 1,006 ~ 4,094
- Other numbers are just using whole range of VLANs in a way of single type.
- *0 and 4,095 are reserved VLAN numbers*
- Before `802.1Q`, there was `ISL(Inter-Switch Link)`
