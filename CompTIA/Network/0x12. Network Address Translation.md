# Network Address Translation

## NAT (Network Address Translation)
- It is estimated that there are over ***20 billion*** devices connected to the Internet 
  *(and the number is keep growing)*
  - `IPv4` can can supports around 4.29 billion addresses 
  - So, the address space for `IPv4` is **exhausted**
    - There are no available addresses to assign anymore
- The `NAT (Network Address Translation)` can resolve this problem.
  - `NAT` is not just used for this purpose, but this is the major uses of it.

## Public Address (vs) Private Address
- The IP addresses can be grouped into `Public Address` or `Private Address`.
- The table below is about the `RFC 1918 private IPv4 address`

| IP address range | # of addresses | Classful Description | Largest CIDR block (subnet mask) | Host ID size |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `10.0.0.0 ~ 10.255.255.255` | 16,777,216 | single class A | 10.0.0.0/8 (255.0.0.0) | 24 bits |
| `172.16.0.0 ~ 172.31.255.255` | 1,048,576 | 16 contiguous class Bs | 172.16.0.0/12 (255.240.0.0) | 20 bits |
| `192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.255.255` | 65,536 | 256 contiguous class Cs | 192.168.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0) | 16 bits |

## NAT (Network Address Translation)
- The `Private IP Addresses` are used inside of a single organization.
- The `NAT` can translate this *private* one into *public* one that could be routed over the internet.

## NAT overload/PAT
- If the number of `computer` on the local network is more than one, it uses `NAT overload (or PAT)`
  - `PAT` means `Port Address Translation`.
- Since the `Switch` connects with multiple computers now, `Router` will have to handle their ***private IP Addresses*** to be translated into ***public IP Addresses***.
- So, `Router` has a table called `NAT Table`, recording the translation between them.

## Port Fowarding
- Another type of ***Network Address Translation***
- **Inbound Communication**
- It allows the external access to internal "server"
  - `External IP/port` number maps to an `Internal IP/port`
- Also called **Destination NAT** or **Static NAT**
  - Destination address is translated from a *public* one to *private* one
  - Does not expire or timeout
