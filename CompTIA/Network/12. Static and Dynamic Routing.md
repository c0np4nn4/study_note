# Static and Dynamic Routing

## Routing
- Send IP Packets across the network
	- Forwarding decisions are based on destination IP address
- Each `Router` only knows the next step
	- The packet asks for directions every hop along the way
	- The list of directions is held in a `routing table`

## Static Routing
- **Administratively define the routes**
- Advantages
	- Easy to configure and manage on smaller networks
	- No overhead from routing protocols (CPU, Memory, Bandwitdh)
	- Easy to configure on sub networks (only one way out)
	- More secure - no routing protocols to analyze
- Disadvantages
	- Difficult to administer on larger networks
	- No automatic method to prevent routing loops
	- If there's a network change, you have to manually update the routes
	- No automatic re-routing if an outage occurs

## Dynamic Routing
- *Routers* send routes to other *routers*
	- Routing tables are updated in (almost) "real-time"
- Advantages
	- No manual route calculations or management
	- New routes are populated automatically
	- Very scalable
- Disadvantages
	- Some router overhead required (CPU, Memory, Bandwidth)
	- Requires some initial configuration to work properly

## Default Route
- A Route when no other route matches
	- The `"gateway of last resort"`
- A remote site may have only one route
	- Go that way -> rest of the world
- Can dramatically simplify the routing process
	- Works in conjunction with all other routing methods
