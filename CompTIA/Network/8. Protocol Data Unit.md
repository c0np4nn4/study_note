# Protocol Data Unit

## PDU (Protocol Data Unit)
- A unit of transmission
	- the data that is sent by a protocol at a particular OSI layer
- Ethernet operates on a frame of data
	- It has no idea what's **Inside**
- IP operates on a packet of data
	- Inside is TCP or UDP, but IP doesn't know about that
- TCP, UDP
	- TCP: Segment,
	- UDP: Datagram

## MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
- The size of the PDU is determined by the MTU
	- but no `fragment`
- Fragmentation slows things down
	- lower the efficiency of whole network
	- (requires overhead along the path)
- Difficult to know the MTU all the way through the path
	- Automated methods are often **inaccurate**
		- especially when ICMP is filtered

## Building an Ethernet Frame
- Start by sending some TCP data across the network.
- Maximum size of the `TCP frame`: 1480 bytes (including 20 bytes from `TCP Header`)
- Put an `IP Header` in front of it, which takes 20 bytes
- And then wrap it up with `DLC Header` for 14 bytes and `Frame Check Sequence` for 4 bytes
- ...and it exceeds the maximum size of the `Ethernet frame` at 1,500 bytes.
- This is the moment the `Fragment` is required

## IP Fragment
- Overview of the Ehternet frame is like below

| DLC Header | IP Header | TCP Header (20 bytes) | TCP Data (24 bytes) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

- Example of fragments are like below

| DLC Header | IP Header | Fragment 1 (Bytes 1-16) |
| --- | --- | --- |

| DLC Header | IP Header | Fragment 1 (Bytes 17-32) |
| --- | --- | --- |

| DLC Header | IP Header | Fragment 1 (Bytes 33-44) |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Troubleshooting MTU
-  MTU sizes are usually configured once
	-  Based on the network infrastructure and don't change often
- A significant concern for `tunneled traffic`(i.e. VPN)
	- The tunnel may be smaller than your local Ethernet Segment
	- It needs to put additional Header for that, and it makes the packet too large
	- So, the fragmentation must be applied
- What if you send packets with Don't Fragment(DF) set?
	- In `IP Header`, DF bit can be set
	- In many cases, fragment is necessary, so the routers will respond back and tell you to fragment
- Troubleshoot using ping is useful
	- sending a `Ping` w/ DF aand force a maximum size of 1472 bytes.
	- 1472 == 1500 bytes (Max. Ethernet Frame size) - 8 bytes (ICMP Header) - 20 bytes (IP Header)
	- after that, you can send any data below that size with no worry
