# Switch Interface Properties

## Basic Interface configuration
- Speed and Duplex
	- could be configured as *automatically*
	- Needs to be **matched** on both sides
- IP address management
	- Layer 3 interfaces on the *Router*
	- *VLAN* interfaces

## VLANs
- VLAN assignment
	- Each device port should be assigned a VLAN
- `Trunking`
	- Connecting switches together
	- Multiple VLANs in a single link
- `Tagged` and `Untagged` VLANs
	- A non-tagged frame is on the default VLAN
		- also called *native VLAN*
	- Trunk ports will tag the outgoing frames
		- and remove the tag on incoming frames

## DMZ
- Demilitarized zone
	- An additional layer of security between the *Internet* and *you*

## Power over Ethernet (PoE)
- Power provided on an Ethernet cable
	- One wire for both *Network* and *Electricity*
	- Phones, cameras, wireless access points
	- Useful in difficult-to-power areas
- Power provided at the switch
	- Built-in power - `Endspans`
	- In-line power injector - `Midspans`
- Power modes
	- Mode A: Power on the data pairs (in other words, one cable)
	- Mode B: Power on the spare pairs (multiple cable)

### PoE and PoE+
- PoE: IEEE 802.3af-2003
	- It is now a normal part of the `IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard`
- PoE+: IEEE 802.3at-2009
	- Also part of the 802.3 standard
	- The updated version of PoE Specification

## Port Mirroring
- Examine a copy of the traffic
	- Port mirror(SPAN: **S**witch **P**ort **AN**alyzer), network tap
	- No way to block (prevent) traffic
