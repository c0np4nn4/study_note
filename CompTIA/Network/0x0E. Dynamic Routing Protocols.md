# Dynamic Routing Protocol

## Dynamic Routing Protocol
- Listen for subnet information from other *Routers*
	- Sent from router to router
- Provide subnet information to other *Routers*
	- Tell other routers what you know
- Determine the **best path** based on the gathered information
- When *network changes* occur, update the available routes
	- Every dynamic routing protocol has its own convergence process

## Which Routing Protocol to use?
- What exactly is a `route`?
	- Is it based on the state of the link?
	- Is it based on how far away it is?
- How does the protocol determine the best path?
	- Some *formula* is applied to the criteria to create a metric
	- Rank the *routes* from best to worst
- Recover after a *change* to the network
	- Convergence time can vary widely between routing protocols
- Standard or proprietary protocol?
	- `OSPF` and `RIP` are standards
	-  Some functions of `EIGRP` are Cisco proprietary

## Distance-vector routing protocols
- Information passed between routers contains routing tables
	- How many `hops` away is another network?
	- The deciding **Vector** is the **Distance**
	- *speed* is not considered
- Usually automatic
	- Very little configuration
	- challenging to manage as the network grows much larger
- Good for smaller networks
	- Doesn't scale well to very large networks
- e.g. `RIP`, `RIPv2`, `EIGRP(Cisco)`

## Link-state routing protocols
- Information passed between routers is related to the current connectivity
	- If it's up, you can get there
	- If it's down, you can't
- Consider the `speed` of the link
	- The faster, The better
- Scalable
	- Used most often in large networks
- e.g. `OSPF`

## Hybrid routing protocols
- A little link-state, a little distance-vector
	- Not many examples of a hybrid routing protocols
- e.g. `BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)`
	- Determines route based on paths, network policies, or configured rule-sets
