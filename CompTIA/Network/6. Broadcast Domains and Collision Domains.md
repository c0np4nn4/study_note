# Broadcast Domains and Collision Domains

## Collision Domains
- A historical footnote
	- It happens in `half-duplex network` time
	- The word `Collision` is perfectly expected, so the point is that how to deal with it.
- The network was one big segment
	- Everyone can hear everyone else's signals
	- It's like one big conference call
- Only one station can "TALK" at a time
	- CSMA(Carrier Sense Multiple Access): "Is the line clear? OK, I can talk now."
- `Collision` happens when there are two people trying to speak at the same time.
	- CD(Collision Detection)
	- Sending the `jam signal`
	- Trying to send it again

## The Collision Domain
- The `Ethernet Network` used to connect together with **coax**.
	- means literally on the same cable
- After starting to use the device **HUB**,  all the devices connected to the HUB sends the frame to the central device, which still has a possibility of collision.
- The only way to segment out these different networks(collision domain), is to put a switch(or bridge) in the middle of the communication.
- So, with `Switch`, we can limit the impact of collision by segmenting the domains.

## The removal of collision domains
- Modern Networks are put the `Switch` in the center of the network, instead of **HUB**.
- In addition, they are enabling  `Full-Duplex communication` between all of the devices.
	- Everyone can both send and receive the data w/o any concern about the collision


## Broadcast Domains
- `Broadcast` could be called Necessary Evil
	- ARP requests
	- Operating system notifications
	- Some dynamic routing protocols
- The broadcast frame will stops at the router (passing by switch/bridge)
- The more devices, the more broadcasts.. So this is the good reason that network should be kept in a convenient size
