# Unicasts, Broadcasts, and Multicasts

## Uni-cast
- 1-to-1 relationship
- i.e. accessing web server
- not an optimal way to transfer data
	- streaming media to the multiple device?
		- have to set up a session for every single devices..

## Broadcast
- 1-to-n relationships (but `n` is the # of every devices in the domain except the sender)
- One packet, received by everyone
- Limited scope
	- The broadcast domain(local subnet)
- i.e Routing updates, ARP requests
- Could be problematic, `IPv6` does not use it.
	- If there are too many broadcast frame, the whole network will slow down.

## Multicast
- 1-to-n relationships (`n` doesn't need to be # of every devices)
- i.e. multimedia delivery
- Very specialized..
	- difficult to scale across large networks
	- every end devices should know how to subscribe or view that multicast information.
