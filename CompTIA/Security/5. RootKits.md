# RootKits

## Rootkits
- Originally a Unix technique
	- The `root` in rootkit
- Modifies **core system files**.
	- Part of the kernel
- Can be invisible to the operating system
	- Won't see it in Task Manager
- Also invisible to traditional anti-virus utilities

## Kernel drivers
### e.g Zeus/Zbot malware
- Famous for Cleaning out bank accounts
	- combined with *rootkit* Necurs (kernel-level driver)
	- Necurs makes sure you can't delete Zbots by denying the access even from the administrator(root)

## Finding and removing rootkits
- Look for the unusual
- Use a remover built AFTER the rootkit is discovered
- Secure boot with UEFI
	- Security in the BIOS
	- prevent any applications from installing into kernel of operating system
